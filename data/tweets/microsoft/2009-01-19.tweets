i think i'm going to buy a microsoft lifecam vx-1000. $60, i know, but that's what investment's all about, right?
i like windows 7. i like all the small & big improvements that microsoft has made over vista.
upset that microsoft won't let me download the technet versions of windows 7, what good is an mcse if you can't make others feel small? :-)
