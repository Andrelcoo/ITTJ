taking a look at the black friday savings posted to the uk apple store. very tempted to get a new macbook...
apple is pretty lame at black friday, except for the eyefi and office discounts, neither of which are their products.
full plate repeat of turkey day dinner this evening, 2 pieces of apple pie...that's rich. very grateful. must. fight. sleep.
@cyprianohawaii i had apple pie for mine ;)
i'm hungry. the apple sauce didn't really help. it just left a funny taste in my mouth. but i can't really eat anything since it's 10:30 pm.
picking up mom and then apple store!
savings to be had from apple - today only.. if you're interested...
i just met a guy working at apple who knew exactly who i was and said we hung out at a party. i should stop drinking.
ps my apple pie is perfect. seriously, it's gorgeous. it makes me almost not want to eat it. th operative word there is almost, fyi.
