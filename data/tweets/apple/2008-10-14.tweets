is excited about the apple media event at 12 for the new notebooks
i'm starting to get excited about what apple will unveil tomorrow, i just hope the engadget tipster is wrong about no macbook refresh.
just watched the apple event, and i really love the new products : )
doesnt like the response he got from apple about the lock port on his macbook pro
@dannyhaak you mean on products? i believe apple already has a special program for those in education (student/teacher)
is anyone following the apple notebook day?

@mattpetri so in your scenario, apple would be more akin to yourself than anyone else? now &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; was a burn :p
i think "it's being refreshed" is apple internal slang for "we're about to take it out back and shoot it between the eyes."
apple tuesday!
i want to see an apple produced tablet mac that is a coventure with wacom. like, a real apple-made one.
interesting that apple have really gone to town explaining the manufacturing process in all of their website copy.
apple notebook event, hoping i dont have to ebay my air.

i'm getting ready for the day, making my to do lists and also prepping to watch the presentation this morning from apple about new laptops.
today is the day apple announces the mew macbook lineup. i'll be watching the live feeds at 12pm (central) and twitter out updates.
@leolaporte apple keeps this up, there pushing away loyal & new customers because of near government like heavy handedness! bite me apple!
honestly, i'm getting a little pissed at apple for constantly releasing new product models . it's very expensive for me.
@markaiken my guess... blue-ray doesn't play with the apple super-drive that does dvd+rw. steve want's an all in one solution.
@jeffcutler well yeah, b/c the apple products are expensive - skews the scale
follows with expectation the apple notebook event
apple "optimized the coefficient of friction on the glass" of the trackpads on their new notebooks. who else does this kind of stuff??
when is apple going to remove the ass-hat, glossy screens? do they even look at a screen for more than an hour at a time?
@lloydb it's not too early to quit apple before you get too deep.

i think apple made it perfectly clear today that they don't and won't make cheap computers (or displays). it's just not their market.
new apple laptops today. time for a quote from steve jobs : "design is not just what it looks like and feels like. design is how it works."
and for the record, yes i think the black keyboard on the new macbooks are ugly. c'mon apple ? what were you thinking ? ? ?
@inkedmn that seems to be par for the course with apple - one of the reasons i have yet to switch.
so apple are actually going to have 4 notebooks on the market! due to they are keeping the older version of the macbook!
@jamesthomson i'm drooling now. too bad apple doesn't let you save your own default.png. it looks funny switching button themes at launch.

hearing that apple is going to keep an old school white macbook available as the low end machine. if so, odd move. that's a dell move.
my predictions for the apple event: new macbooks (duh) all aluminum casing, mbair updates, and "one more thing"
@chexee understood, but one thing apple people have always asked for and never, ever gotten was a cheap machine.

@corvida apple macbook event.
so when is apple going to sell a standalone wired/wireless trackpad for the imac?
holy hell, the apple store is getting pounded!
i predict apple is going black/silver with all there products, i predict time capsule, airport, and everything will be black and silver.
hell's yeah with some buyer's remorse... damn you apple inc!!!!!
how come when the aussie dollar goes up it takes apple 2 years to adjust the price, but when it goes down it only takes a week. grr aapl.
