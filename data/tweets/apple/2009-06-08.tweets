@o2 i think you're going to face pr issues if you dont give some sort of incentive for existing 3g holders.. apple people r challenging..
following apple fanboys watching #wwdc - i think they're about to burst soon if no new iphone - kind of funny, really.

rt: @michaelseidlitz: apple wwdc 2009 live audio stream http://ping.fm/3kteb
i like what apple did with the macbook and macbook pro lines. just calling the white mac a "book" and the al casing a "pro" makes more sense
@jahsonblack not very happy with apple right now...imac died!! 2nd time in 2 weeks!!
longest apple event ever!
rt @ericasadun: today's keynote brought to you by the apple department of redundancy department nothing big to announce so march is on rerun
really digging what i'm reading from the apple conference today
many features of the iphone 3gs can be found in other device. but apple just knows how to make everything cool.
safari 4 to have full history search including cover flow view of browsing history. safari 4 is fastest browser now, says apple #wwdc
so apple conference reminds me of the nintendo one. nothing of note at all. most exciting news? iphone for $99. which will never reach uk
so i just bought a laptop last week, and today apple upgraded them. curses&gt;
nerd-related excitement, waiting for apple new products!
apple store is now offline.....iphone announcement immanent?...wallet at the ready...
apple = fail
i'm so tired of apple sending me pic's of thier new product's coming....i don't even think thier great in some areas......
relief! rt @wired rt @gadgetlab: new phone from apple: iphone 3g s where s stands for speed. same design, but 2-3x faster, apple says #wwdc
@linlee888 sweet green apple :) at&t t winner too
@micahgodbolt be sure to take sun screen and water. it was a miserable wait last year (though apple employees handed out refreshments, etc)
red alert! red alert! apple store is down!!!! ;)
apple is offering snow leopard upgrade for $29? that is a huge move! microsoft, palm and blackberry are probably getting pretty nervous!
hey @leolaporte mac users should appreciate win7. it makes apple drive down prices to compete. (leo laporte live live &gt; http://ustre.am/oa)
is anyone selling an apple iphone?
mac wwdc '09 keynote has concluded. tried to keep up with live blogs. can't wait for apple to release the video podcast! #wwdc
if tomorrow's apple announcement is really truly wonderful i might just get an iphone b/c it will be much cheaper for me.
@jashworth57 scared me there. i'd imagine apple would throw a huge fit if palm emulated native apps. my mom and brother are getting pres.
i'm really pissed that apple thinks i'd pay $699 for a 32gb iphone, after already having bought 2. i won't buy one anytime soon...
new apple iphone 3gs out soon...looks nice...http://bit.ly/12afwr
@twitter you should increase the allowed num of reqs per hour during apple keynotes. i can't stop refreshing, i just can't!
latest wwdcnew apple tablet vd has been released ...omg omg http://tinyurl.com/qpjnkr
i think apple pretty much fixed/added everything i wanted with the 3gs - video, tethering, voice dialing, media sms, better battery life!
is it christmas eve? i always get confused before a big apple announcement. been mixing the two up for years now.
volg live blog van apple presentatie over nieuwe soft- en hardware. fraaie nieuwe laptops en subliem verfijnde versie van os x.
i want a baby snow leopard coat is that awful im thinking fendi or louis vuitton wud b a dream apple setting up wireless today xoxo
does apple want iphone 3gs buyers to go blind or die of boredom? http://m.mippin.com/t/4sisqa
apple will announce a new iphone and snow leopard in a couple of hours. how exciting!
trying to locate apple feed to see about the new iphone.
#wwdcnl site van apple doet bij mij niks meer :o
