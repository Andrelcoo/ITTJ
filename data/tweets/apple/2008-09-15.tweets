it's interesting how apple took the most uninteresting ipod colour model, and made it the most beautiful. silver before was boring.
grr and now my iphone's battery is sucking. 2.25 hours of usage and approaching the 20% warning. *sigh* apple products hate me... =[
can't stop thinking about the app store. the good & bad. also notice how "app store" has become synonymous with apple already? #1 in google
so by the looks of these new microsoft ads, apple better watch out. looks like a whole group of re-switchers is going to take place.
apple press conference was pretty boring. food was awesomeo though.
