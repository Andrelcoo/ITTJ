new iphone 3g won't charge...another doa apple product for me. my theory is macs/iphones don't like being near pcs.
trivia: clicking itunes' capacity bar changes units, but clicking words or numbers doesn't. why does my apple tv have 2 blues, but 1 in key?
well designs is one thing, but hopelessly romanticizing a piece of gadget is another. try being different. apple did, now you should too.
