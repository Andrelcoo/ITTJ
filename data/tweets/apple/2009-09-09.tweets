@zyote so how many ipods will you have in your collection as soon as the apple store reopens its online doors?
*sigh* this is the side of apple that irritates me, the snarky misinformative side. 21,178 games, ok, but how many of those are worthwhile?

@y2kjon i'd agree, with maybe beetles on itunes as well. think apple might be stingy and only have cameras on the touch.
is wondering what apple will announce today at it's special media event. it already reduced the price on most ipods ahead of the event.

awesome apple event but anyone else notice that it took apple almost a decade to add a built-in fm radio?

i can almost taste the depression and confusion from apple fanboys over the weird nano announcement.

worth staying up tonight for the apple event? i slept two hours this afternoon in preparation :p
why does apple always make itunes different from osx? first the scroll bars, now the brushed metal. (that said i prefer the new version).
maybe checking for updates for my mac book during the middle of a major apple event wasn't the greatest idea
steve jobs doing the apple keynote! i knew he'd be back. way to go steve!!!
