well today is better than yesterday, but i'm so busy i'm missing the apple show. gah!
my apple prediction: the organic apple i purchased at the supermarket that is in my office will go bad before i decide to eat it.
first apple sells me music i can't play on my nokia e71 and now they want me to pay extra for the privelege !? typical! itunes no more!
i'm smiling, cause i'm happy. woohhhh apple &lt;3
phil closed the keynote by saying this was "the last macworld". he meant the last macworld apple keynote, of course. prophetic?
