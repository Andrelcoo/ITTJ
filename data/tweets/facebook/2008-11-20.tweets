new to twitter...may even abandon facebook for this.
can anybody tell me how can i stop facebook frm pulling my tweets as my facebook status
facebook is ontzettend niet geschikt voor kleine schermpjes
facebook should change the "friends" tab to "acquaintances" or "i once talked to this person sometime in my life". "friends" is pushing it.
