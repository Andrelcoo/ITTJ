@digsby facebook doesn't seem to be able to connect. is this a known issue? or am i the only one?
@technosailor true, but they are not lumped into 1 ranking. not everyone is on twitter or facebook etc. for the same reason.
catching up with chritmas facebook messages
facebook just gave me a newsfeed from a week ago. it fixed on refresh but still weird.
it would seem facebook got infected by the twitter failwhale.

damn i just realized i guess i have to facebook and myspace that too. it's hard out here for a lazy pimp.
@fearphage - because i have my twitter updating my facebook status. i wouldn't use twitter if it wasn't for this.
will you be lucky enough to be invited to the next2friends facebook group and twitter group ?
@perrybelcher was it u who gave a link on how to send a webcast on facebook to friends?

otras viejas que me agregan al facebook y no conozco, maldita gente... por que tiene que ser asi?
i think i will twitter without friend feed... and just integrate twitter and facebook - is that a simpler solution?
facebook just went down for me.
facebook *really* does not want you to log in without going through login.facebook.com. also, it dislikes when you request a lot of tokens.
is facebook really slow today, or is it just me? i'm building my library a fb page and it suddenly slowed to a crawl.
@juliandarley there's a twitter app for facebook - if you use friendfeed too it will dupe your posts unless you turn one of them off.
