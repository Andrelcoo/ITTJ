the wire complete series: $82 on amazon - today only. normally $250!
thankful to whoever bought a macbook pro through my amazon associates acct. but wondering why i only got 1.3%. oh well.
@masto i'd say that's typical amazon pricing that fluctuates from day to day. but i agree, at $370, the fw800 drobo is hard to pass up.
i love amazon custom-made packages. an example of an investition that is not only about money, but also makes the world better.
@davymac cool. want instant gratification but i suppose if i ordered on amazon now i'd have by sat morn anyway.
awesome awesome . first a free proto.in pass, now a google bubble radio and a amazon 20$ claim card and a tshirt :d.
