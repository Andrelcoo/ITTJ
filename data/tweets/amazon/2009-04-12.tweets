@sarahw #amazonfail i've been boycotting amazon for over a yr. now, b/c of their deleting honest, critical reviews of bad books.
if amazon is not overwhelmed by your protests, then they will not know how serious their position is. break their phone banks. #amazonfail
i no longer exist on amazon if you do a search on all departments rather than just books, same result when ancestral magic is searched for.

@gwynsmom so since your kid is computer savvy, amazon needs to censor itself? i thought it was your job to be your kid's parent.
@neilhimself that amazon rank removal is just...insidious. most of my own novels wouldn't have a rank if they were telling the truth.
