@feliciaday my money is on a large format multi-touch device from apple. amazon iphone reader displays content in color + email, web, etc.
if amazon is focusing on the new larger screen kindle to impact education, they better bring the price way down!!!
@pragdave not shocked amazon would pull this. apple might one day be no better, if their control of iphone app distribution is an indicator.
